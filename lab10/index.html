			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>I had some problems with properly calling certain items. I wasn't able to figure out what the issue was, but I did find a work around.</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>Specifically I had issues calling outputEl. It kept saying it wasn't defined even though it clearly was. I was able to find a work around in sections thanks to one of my other classmates</p>

			<h2>Reults</h2>
				<p>You can see the results of my work on the page. If you put your name in it will give you a new one.</p>

				Input Name: <input type="text" id="user-name"></input>
				<button id="my-button">Get New Name</button>

			<h2>Output</h2>
