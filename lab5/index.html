	<h1>Lab 5: Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>

	<h2>Challenge</h2>
	<div id = "summary">
		<p>There were no major issues outside of a couple clarifying questions that I asked the TA. My partner and I did have a bit of trouble thinking of some good tasks to make steps for at first, but we figured it out pretty quick. Although notably there was apparently an ongoing issue with Glitch not working for other students. Besides that the entire process went quite smooth and I was able to experiment a bit with the homepage.</p>

	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<div id = "summary">
		<p>Because my partner and I didn't have any major issues we didn't really have any problems that needed to be solved for</p>

	<h2>Reults</h2>
	<div id = "summary">
		<p>You can see the reults of my work below. I've included our Pseudocode that was made in google docs as well as pictures of the index.html for this page. This page is also building on my experience customizing website pages with CSS</p>
