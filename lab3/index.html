	<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
	<p>The idea of the lab was to create a local file structure leading to each of the seperate index.html files. Being careful to make sure that everything linked together properly</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p> I was able to get the hang of the coding relatively quickly through the help of the example screenshots in the assignment as well as my partner, however for some reason the links were not working properly. It turned out the reason for this was that I had been coding in the wrong index.html file. I had been using the lab 3 index.html instead of the art101/index.html. After swapping it everything worked fine </p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>This page is the results of my efforts, below are images of my file structure and the various index.html I've used to program the site.</p>
