	<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
	<p>The idea of the lab was to create a local file structure leading to each of
		 the seperate index.html files. Being careful to make sure that everything
		 linked together properly</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>I was able to get the hang of the coding relatively quickly through the
		 help of the example screenshots in the assignment as well as my partner,
		 however for some reason the links were not working properly. It turned out
		 the reason for this was that I had been coding in the wrong index.html file.
		 I had been using the lab 3 index.html instead of the art101/index.html.
		 After swapping it everything worked fine </p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>This page is the results of my efforts, below are images of my file
		 structure and the various index.html I've used to program the site.</p>
