			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The main issue I had was related to getting the js file to properly show up as well as getting the bonus tasks to work properly. At least in terms of the bonus tasks I was unable to figure out how to accomplish them in time.</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>The main problem, linking the js file, ended up being due to a misplaced comma. This was a simlar issue to what I had in lab 6 except this time there was a period where the comma should have been which made it even harder to spot.</p>

			<h2>Reults</h2>
				<p>You can see the reults of my work on this page. Below it will give you a new name based on what it was you inputted</p>
