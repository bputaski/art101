			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>I didn't have major problems with the lab although I admittedly had help from both my partner and the repository. That being said I found this lab easier to understand then the last couples labs we've been given.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="problem" class="sectionbox">
			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I didn't have any major problems. I briefly had duplicate buttons, but that was due to a minor misunderstanding on my part.</p>
			</div>

		<div id="results" class="sectionbox">
			<h2>Reults</h2>
				<p>You can see the results of my work on the page. You should be able to toggle the colors of the different sections</p>
