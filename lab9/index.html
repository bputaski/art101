			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>My partner and I tried to print out the javascript outputs in the html itself, but were unable to. Other than that everything went very smoothly</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>While looking at sites like stack overflow we struggled to understand what it was we needed to do and where to even start. other than that there were no problems.</p>

			<h2>Reults</h2>
				<p>if you open the console you should be able to see the results of my javascript code</p>

			<h2>Output</h2>
			<div id = "output">
			</div>
