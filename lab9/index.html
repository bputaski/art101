			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>There weren't any major issues my partner and I had, although there were some initial problems with using appendChild. We had to ultimately look for help in an outside website</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>We were originally unable to use appendChild, but were able to get it to work by using createTextNode on the new elements</p>

			<h2>Reults</h2>
				<p>You can see the result of the JavaScript on both the website and in the console</p>

			<h2>Output</h2>
